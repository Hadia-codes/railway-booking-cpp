# 🚆 Railway Reservation System (C++)

A simple and effective terminal-based Railway Reservation System built using C++. This project simulates the process of booking, canceling, modifying, and displaying train tickets using core programming concepts like file handling, arrays, and structures.

---

## 📝 Project Description

Train travel is a common mode of transport, but handling reservations manually can be chaotic and error-prone. This project introduces a digital Railway Reservation System that allows users to easily book, modify, cancel, and display train tickets.

The goal is to build a beginner-friendly, real-life application that strengthens understanding of C++ fundamentals such as file handling, loops, arrays, structures, and conditionals.

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Train Passengers**: Seeking a fast and convenient way to book and manage their reservations.
- **Railway Personnel**: To monitor and maintain passenger records with ease.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build an intuitive interface for ticket booking and reservation tracking.
- Ensure a seamless user experience for booking, updating, or canceling tickets.
- Safely store passenger details for future retrieval or modification.

## 🔑 Core Features

### ✅ Book a Ticket
- Enter passenger name, age, train name, seat number.
- Auto-generate a unique **Ticket ID**.
- Store all information securely using file handling.

### 📋 Display All Booked Tickets
- View all reservation records.
- See ticket ID, passenger name, age, train, and seat number.

### ❌ Cancel a Ticket
- Enter a ticket ID to cancel the booking.
- Only the selected ticket is deleted — others remain safe.

### 📝 Modify a Ticket
- Enter ticket ID to update name, age, train, or seat number.
- Edits are reflected instantly and stored.

### 🔚 Exit System
- Exits the system safely without data loss.

## 🧾 Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, you’ll have a system that allows you to:
- 📌 Book tickets with passenger details
- 👀 View all tickets
- ❌ Cancel tickets using Ticket ID
- 🖊️ Modify existing tickets
- 🔐 Exit system while saving all changes

All operations are reflected in real-time and stored in files to prevent data loss.
